  <!-- The Loop (The Item's Journey) -->
  <!-- Starts near the top-right, goes around counter-clockwise (time/waiting), and turns inward to point back at the center. -->
  <!-- To look like a "Q" or Magnifying glass, the tail usually is bottom right. -->
  <!-- Let's make it look like a refresh arrow that locks onto the target. -->

  <!-- The Arrow Pointer (The tail of the 'Q' pointing in) -->
  <!-- The arc ends at 150, 362 (bottom left). We want it to point towards 256,256. -->
  <!-- Let's add a straight line segment pointing in, with an arrowhead. -->
  <!-- Vector from (150,362) to center is roughly (106, -106) direction. -->
